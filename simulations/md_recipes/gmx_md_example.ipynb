If you prefer to use, for instance, PDB format, all you need to do is to specify an appropriate file name with .pdb extension as your output. The purpose of pdb2gmx is to produce a force field-compliant topology; the output structure is largely a side effect of this purpose and is intended for user convenience.

That is, a protein should never see its periodic image, otherwise the forces calculated will be spurious.
